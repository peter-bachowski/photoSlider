# photoSlider

The idea of this project is to show how photos may be used in a carousel type of set up and will also be using a timer so the photos will alternate every set interval. A simple project but some parts are tricky. 

For this project I have selected five nature photos from unsplash.com to show this effect.

Thank you for reading through the readme file as well as your interest in my project.
